<h1>Introduction To Industrial Training</h1>

<p>In today's context, whilst a Degree is not a guarantee for a succesful employment opportunity, it is a reliable indicator of an individual's competency. On the other hand graduates must update their knowledge, practical experience, soft skills and attitudes to be competitive in the job market. Thus the industrial training is a vital component which improves competency of a graduate as a corporate leader.</p>

<p>Industrial Training Programme (ITP) is designed to provide the students with a supervised practical training withina specified time-frame. The training can be carried out in a government or private sector organization, and it includes the job training as well as the research based training.
Aims of the Programme.</p>

<p>The main aim of the ITP is to produce graduates who are ready to face the industry. The programme also expects to develop competent graduates who are able to apply the knowledge acquired at the institute in a practical working environment. By exploring the real working experience, students under- stand expectations and guidelines of the business arena which lead to improve the chance of employment after graduation. This is a continuous effort done by National School of Business Management to eliminate the gap between academia and industry. Feedback received from employers who are part of the programme is used to improve the existing curriculum in line with the needs of the industry.

<ul>
<li>To provide students an opportunity to experience the real work situation by applying knowledge and skills learnt in the class room</li>
<li>To provide work experience to students while they are studying in their final years</li>
<li>To expose students to the working environment, common practices, employment opportunities and work ethics in their relevant fields</li>
<li>To inculcate soft skills that are expected by employers</li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning Outcomes</h1>

<ul>
	<li>improve their competencies relevant to their area of study.</li>
    <li>relate the knowledge and skills acquired at the workplace to their higher studies.</li>
    <li>compete effectively in the job market with the equipped competencies.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Scope Of The Industrial Training</h1>

<p>Job duties of trainees can be decided by the employer based on their competencies in relation to specific fields.
